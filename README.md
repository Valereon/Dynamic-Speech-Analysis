# Dynamic-Speech-Analysis

Dynamic Speech Analysis is about, taking an audio input live or recorded, taking a sentiment analysis on it, and deciding which parts are what emotion and customizable tags to it. Was originally programmed in mind for use with an LLM in correspondence with something like [An app to have a verbal conversation with ChatGPT.](https://github.com/DougDougGithub/Babagaboosh)

## The Goal:
To end up with a cmd program that takes a audio file as input and assign sentiment tags in any way the user chooses with as little setup as possible
